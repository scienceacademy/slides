A message from Mr. Bradfield.

Students, I want you to know that I have really enjoyed our time together this school year. Though it's been challenging to do everything via Zoom rather than in person, you've learned a lot and you should be proud of what you've accomplished.

8th graders, I wish you all the best success in your high school careers. For those of you staying here at the Science Academy, I look forward to seeing you in my AP class in 11th grade!

7th graders, I'm excited to see you all in person in my classroom next year, and I'm really looking forward to all the hands-on science and engineering projects we'll be working on.

Stay safe and have a wonderful summer break.

Excellent work. You might have a future in cryptography. Here's your secret challenge:

Take the following sequence: 1487, 4817, 8147

It is unusual in two ways: (a) each number is prime, and (b) each number is a permutation of one another.

There is one other 4-digit sequence like this.

What 12-digit number do you get by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

You'll probably need Python to solve this one.
